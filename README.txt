# Analyzing Car Reviews with LLMs

## Project Overview
This project analyzes car reviews using Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract insights, perform sentiment analysis, and translate reviews into different languages. It demonstrates the potential of LLMs in natural language processing tasks.

## Features
- Sentiment analysis of car reviews.
- Translation of reviews into different languages.
- Insights from textual data using advanced LLMs.
